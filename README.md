# VIRUS-SCANNER
This project scans the virus of your file
How to Use:
When you run the script, a window will appear with a button labeled "Scan File".
Clicking "Scan File" opens a file dialog for you to select a file to scan.
After selecting the file, the program calculates its hash and checks if it matches any known virus signatures. It will display the result in a popup (either indicating a virus or stating that the file is clean).
